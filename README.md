# Happy Home
Happy home = happy life. Introducing a minimalist all-in-one food, water, fitness, and period tracker to aid you in keeping track of your well-being. Have fun adding snacks, growing your plant + more!
## Inspiration
It all started with us being unhappy with how most period trackers look. With how most period trackers look, we felt that they were too complex for our needs. We wanted to design our own that was both functional and with a design that makes us happy. As such, we wanted to put it in a less obvious place, along with letting the app be more than just a period tracker, which led us to Happy Home.
## What it does
Happy Home is a mobile app that is complete with a login page and four different functions. Each function can be accessed with one of the four tiles on the main page, correlating to different home aspects and trackers: kitchen -> food, cabinet -> period, plant->water, front door->fitness. 
## Running Happy Home
1. Install flutter for your OS. 
2. Add flutter to PATH.
3. Execute `flutter run`
## How we built it
We used Firebase and Flutter to create our mobile home. Firestore was used to store user information.
## Challenges we ran into
Both of us had minimal experience with design in Flutter, making layouts and design decisions a challenge for us. We also ran into syncing issues when retrieving our data from Firestore. We also wanted to have a tile for mental health/wellness, but we struggled to find a suitable API.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we successfully integrated Firebase and finished most of the functionality that we had planned.
## What we learned
We learned how to make a functional application with multiple screens and compatibility with constantly changing real-time data from a cloud database.
## What's next for Happy Home
We would want to add an option to toggle the calendar for the food page and add the option to see any previous month's data.  Additionally, for the water tracker, we would want to add a progress bar instead of saying # of cups drank, that way it is clear how close the user is to the 8 cups goal. We also want to add a mental health/wellness tile.
